PROJECT DESCRIPTION

Description:
This project demonstrates the integration of a third-party weather API into a responsive web application. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches real-time weather data based on user input (city name or geolocation) and displays key metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The goal is to provide users with a fast, intuitive interface for checking current weather updates in any location.

 Features:
Real-time weather data using OpenWeatherMap API (or similar)

City-based search functionality

Dynamic UI updates based on API response

Error handling for invalid inputs or failed requests

Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

 Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)

API: OpenWeatherMap REST API

Tools: Lite-server for local development, Git for version control

Objectives:
Learn how to consume RESTful APIs using JavaScript

Practice asynchronous programming with fetch() and Promises

Build a user-friendly interface for real-time data display

Understand basic error handling and API response parsing
